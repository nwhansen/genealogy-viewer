# Genealogy Visualizer

This application aims to provide powerful and simple graphing for complex family trees. 

It provides the ability to graph thousands of individuals and their relations due to its usage of [Microsoft MSAGL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-automatic-graph-layout/). This can make complicated family trees dificult to read, but it will graph them accuratly. 

This application requires a computer with *.NET* 4.0 or greater, meaning this application will work with Windows XP or later.
